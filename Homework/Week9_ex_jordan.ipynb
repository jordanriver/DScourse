    "### Easy (6 Exercises)\n",
    "1. **Load and Inspect Data**: Use pandas to load a given housing dataset and display the first five rows.\n",
    "2. **Plotting Relationships**: Create a scatter plot using matplotlib to visualize the relationship between 'SalePrice' and 'LotArea'.\n",
    "3. **Basic Linear Regression**: Build a simple linear regression model with sklearn to predict 'SalePrice' from 'LotArea'.\n",
    "4. **Model Coefficients**: Extract and display the coefficients (slope, intercept) of the trained linear regression model.\n",
    "5. **Basic Prediction**: Predict 'SalePrice' for a new 'LotArea' value using the trained model.\n",
    "6. **Basic Data Split**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets with a 70-30 ratio using `train_test_split`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Medium (8 Exercises)\n",
    "7. **Residual Calculation**: Calculate the residuals for a small set of predictions from the linear model.\n",
    "8. **Simple Model Evaluation**: Compute the R-squared score for the simple linear regression model on the test set.\n",
    "9. **Visualize Regression Line**: Plot the regression line for 'SalePrice' against 'LotArea' using seaborn.\n",
    "10. **Simple Residuals Plotting**: Create a plot showing residuals versus fitted values for the linear regression model.\n",
    "11. **Multiple Linear Regression**: Extend to multiple linear regression using two predictor variables (e.g., 'LotArea' and 'OverallQual') to predict 'SalePrice'.\n",
    "12. **Cross-Validation**: Implement 5-fold cross-validation on the linear regression model and calculate the average R-squared score.\n",
    "13. **Interpreting Coefficients**: Interpret the coefficients of the multiple linear regression model and their impact on 'SalePrice'.\n",
    "14. **Prediction with Multiple Regression**: Use the multiple regression model to predict 'SalePrice' for a new set of predictor values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hard (6 Exercises)\n",
    "15. **Error Analysis**: Analyze the residuals of the multiple regression model to identify any patterns.\n",
    "16. **Impact of Feature Removal**: Observe the effect on model performance when excluding a feature from the multiple regression model.\n",
    "17. **Exploring Correlation**: Examine the correlation between 'SalePrice' and various other variables in the dataset.\n",
    "18. **Advanced Visualization**: Create a seaborn pair plot for a subset of variables in the housing dataset to explore relationships.\n",
    "19. **Model Comparison**: Compare the performance of simple and multiple linear regression models based on their R-squared scores.\n",
    "20. **Feature Importance Observation**: Observe which features seem to have the most significant impact on 'SalePrice' based on the coefficients in the multiple regression model."
